# Azure Data Catalog - Bulk register and annotate

This sample shows you how to bulk register and annotate data assets from an Excel workbook using the Data Catalog REST API and Open XML.

To get started using this sample, you first need to build the executable, following below steps:
*	Download the sample project
* Open it in Visual Studio and install the latest version of dependent NuGet packages (e.g. Microsoft.IdentityModel.Clients.ActiveDirectory)
* Create (or use and existing) Azure Active Directory Application ID and the corresponding information. If you do not have one and need instructions on how to get one, you can check [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/rest/api/datacatalog/register-a-client-app)
* Compile the app.
* You are now ready to run it.
